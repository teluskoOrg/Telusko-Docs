title: Lambda Expression Basics
---

## 1. Introduction

A **lambda expression** in Java is a compact way to write a small piece of logic without creating a separate class.  
It is mainly used to provide the implementation of a **functional interface** (an interface with exactly one abstract method).

Lambda expressions became important in Java because many modern APIs (like Stream API) need a clean way to pass behavior such as:

- filtering logic
- sorting logic
- mapping/conversion logic
- short callback-like actions

Instead of writing long boilerplate code, lambdas allow writing the same logic in a shorter and more readable way.



## 2. What Problem Lambda Solves

Before lambdas, if you wanted to pass a behavior, you usually wrote:

- a separate class, or
- an anonymous inner class

Both approaches work, but they are verbose for small logic.

Lambda helps when:

- the logic is short
- it is used once or a few times
- the interface has exactly one method (functional interface)



## 3. Lambda Works Only With Functional Interfaces

A lambda expression can be assigned only to a type that has **exactly one abstract method**.

Example functional interface:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Greeting {
    void sayHello();
}
````

Now a lambda can implement it.



## 4. Basic Syntax of Lambda Expression

General form:

```java
(parameters) -> { body }
```

Key parts:

* `parameters` are inputs to the method
* `->` separates inputs and implementation
* `body` is the method logic



## 5. First Example (No Parameters)

Functional interface:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Greeting {
    void sayHello();
}
```

Lambda implementation:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Greeting g = () -> System.out.println("Hello");
        g.sayHello();
    }
}
```

Here `() ->` means the method takes no input.



## 6. Lambda With One Parameter

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Printer {
    void print(String message);
}
```

Lambda:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Printer p = msg -> System.out.println(msg);
        p.print("Welcome to Java");
    }
}
```

Note:

* For single parameter, parentheses are optional: `msg -> ...`



## 7. Lambda With Multiple Parameters

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Operation {
    int apply(int a, int b);
}
```

Lambda:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Operation add = (a, b) -> a + b;
        System.out.println(add.apply(10, 20));
    }
}
```

Output:

```
30
```



## 8. Lambda Body: Single Statement vs Block

### 8.1 Single Statement Body

No braces needed:

```java
Operation add = (a, b) -> a + b;
```

### 8.2 Block Body

Use braces when you need multiple statements:

```java
Operation add = (a, b) -> {
    int result = a + b;
    return result;
};
```

When you use `{ }`, `return` is required if method returns a value.



## 9. Type Inference in Lambda

You usually do not need to write types:

```java
(a, b) -> a + b
```

Because Java infers types from the functional interface method signature.

But you can explicitly write them if needed:

```java
(int a, int b) -> a + b
```



## 10. Lambda Is Not a Method, It Is an Implementation

A lambda expression does not create a new named method.
It provides the implementation of the single abstract method of a functional interface.

So this:

```java
Operation add = (a, b) -> a + b;
```

means:

* `add` is an object reference
* pointing to an implementation of `Operation.apply(a,b)`



## 11. Common Mistakes

### 11.1 Trying to use lambda with non-functional interface

If an interface has 2 abstract methods, lambda cannot be used.

### 11.2 Confusing lambda with overloading

A lambda is matched by the target type (functional interface).
If Java cannot decide the target type, you get compilation errors.

### 11.3 Using braces without return for non-void method

This is invalid:

```java
// Operation add = (a, b) -> { a + b; }; // invalid
```

Correct:

```java
Operation add = (a, b) -> { return a + b; };
```



## 12. Summary

* Lambda expression is a short way to implement a functional interface.
* Works only when there is exactly one abstract method.
* Syntax: `(parameters) -> body`
* Parentheses optional for one parameter, required for multiple.
* Use braces for multiple statements, and return when needed.
* Lambda provides implementation of the interface method, not a separate named method.

title: Data Hiding vs Encapsulation
---

## 1. Introduction

In Java and object-oriented programming, two concepts often appear together:

- **Data Hiding**
- **Encapsulation**

Although they are closely related, they are **not the same**.  
Understanding the difference is essential for writing secure, maintainable, and clean object-oriented code.

This chapter explains both concepts in depth and demonstrates how they work together to protect data and control access.



## 2. What Is Data Hiding?

**Data Hiding** means restricting direct access to the internal data of a class.  
The goal is to protect sensitive information from being misused or modified incorrectly.

### Key Points

- Achieved using **private access modifiers**
- Prevents external code from directly accessing fields
- Enforces security and ensures correct usage
- Encourages controlled access through methods

### Example (Data Hiding)

```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // hidden data

    public void deposit(double amt) {
        if (amt > 0) balance += amt;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
````

Here, `balance` is hidden from outside access.
No other class can do:

```java
acc.balance = 5000; // Not allowed
```

The data remains protected.

## 3. What Is Encapsulation?

**Encapsulation** is the process of bundling:

* Data (fields)
* Behavior (methods)

together into a single unit (a class) and controlling how that data is accessed or modified.

### Key Points

* Encapsulation = Data + Methods bundled together
* Use **public getters and setters** to control access
* Provides validation and control logic
* Ensures the object’s internal state remains consistent

### Example (Encapsulation)

```java
class Student {
    private int age;

    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0 && age <= 120) {
            this.age = age;
        }
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}
```

This class **encapsulates** the field `age` and exposes safe access methods.



## 4. Difference Between Data Hiding and Encapsulation

Although related, they serve different purposes.

### **Data Hiding → Security**

### **Encapsulation → Implementation + Control**

| Feature     | Data Hiding                           | Encapsulation                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Definition  | Restricting access to data            | Binding data and methods together    |
| Achieved by | private variables                     | class structure + getters/setters    |
| Purpose     | Protect data from unauthorized access | Manage and control data operations   |
| Focus       | Security                              | Implementation and behavior          |
| Example     | Making fields private                 | Using getters/setters to modify data |



### Example Demonstrating Both Concepts Together

```java
class Employee {
    private double salary; // data hidden

    // Encapsulation via controlled access
    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        if (salary > 0) this.salary = salary;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }
}
```

* `salary` is hidden → **data hiding**
* Controlled operations through methods → **encapsulation**

Both concepts work together to create a secure and controlled class design.


## 5. Why Both Are Needed

### 5.1 Prevent Misuse

Without data hiding, anyone can corrupt the state:

```java
student.age = -10; // invalid
```

### 5.2 Ensure Valid State

Encapsulation allows validation:

```java
setAge(-10); // will not modify age
```

### 5.3 Improve Maintainability

Internal implementation can change without breaking external code.

### 5.4 Enhances Code Robustness

Objects remain consistent and predictable.



## 6. Common Misunderstandings

### Misconception 1: Data hiding and encapsulation are the same.

No.
Data hiding is a **feature**, encapsulation is a **process**.

### Misconception 2: Encapsulation is only about getters/setters.

Encapsulation is the principle of combining data and behavior — getters/setters are just one way to implement it.

### Misconception 3: You can have data hiding without encapsulation.

Yes, but encapsulation usually builds on top of data hiding to provide controlled access.



## 7. Summary

* **Data hiding** protects internal data using access modifiers like **private**.
* **Encapsulation** bundles data and methods, providing controlled access through public interfaces.
* Data hiding ensures **security**, while encapsulation ensures **control and consistency**.
* Both concepts work together to create reliable and maintainable object-oriented systems.

This completes **Data Hiding vs Encapsulation**.

## 1. Introduction

Arithmetic operators in Java are used to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.  
These operators work with **primitive numeric types** like:

- `int`
- `float`
- `double`
- `long`
- `short`
- `byte`

Understanding arithmetic operators is foundational for performing calculations in Java programs, including loops, conditions, formulas, financial calculations, and more.



## 2. Types of Arithmetic Operators

Java provides five primary arithmetic operators:

| Operator | Meaning            | Example     |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| `+`      | Addition            | `a + b`     |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `a - b`     |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `a * b`     |
| `/`      | Division            | `a / b`     |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder) | `a % b`     |

## 3. Addition (+)

Used for both numeric addition and string concatenation.

### Numeric Addition

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int sum = a + b; // 30
````

### String Concatenation

```java
String result = "Hello " + "World"; // Hello World
```

Mixed addition:

```java
System.out.println("Total = " + 5 + 5); 
// Output: Total = 55 (because first part is string)
```

Use parentheses for numeric addition:

```java
System.out.println("Total = " + (5 + 5)); 
// Output: Total = 10
```



## 4. Subtraction (-)

```java
int a = 20;
int b = 5;
int diff = a - b; // 15
```

Also works with floating-point numbers:

```java
double x = 5.5 - 2.1; // 3.4
```



## 5. Multiplication (*)

```java
int a = 6;
int b = 4;
int product = a * b; // 24
```



## 6. Division (/)

Division behaves differently for integers and floating-point types.

### Integer Division

```java
int a = 7;
int b = 2;
int result = a / b; // 3 (decimal part discarded)
```

### Floating-Point Division

```java
double x = 7.0 / 2; // 3.5
```

### Division by Zero

* Integer division by zero → **ArithmeticException**
* Floating division by zero → `Infinity` or `NaN`

Example:

```java
System.out.println(5.0 / 0);   // Infinity
System.out.println(0.0 / 0);   // NaN
```



## 7. Modulus (%)

Returns the remainder after division.

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 3;
int remainder = a % b; // 1
```

Useful for:

* Checking even/odd numbers
* Circular patterns
* Clock calculations
* Loop cycling

Example:

```java
if (n % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Even");
}
```

## 8. Operator Behavior with Different Data Types

### Mixing int and double

```java
int a = 5;
double b = 2.0;
double result = a + b; // 7.0
```

Java automatically promotes smaller types (`byte`, `short`) to `int` in arithmetic expressions.

Example:

```java
byte x = 10;
byte y = 20;
byte z = (byte)(x + y); // x+y becomes int → cast required
```



## 9. Precedence with Arithmetic Operators

Operator precedence:

1. `*`, `/`, `%` → higher precedence
2. `+`, `-` → lower precedence

Example:

```java
int result = 10 + 5 * 2; // 20
```

Correct way if you want addition first:

```java
int result = (10 + 5) * 2; // 30
```



## 10. Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Calculate Area

```java
double radius = 5;
double area = 3.14 * radius * radius;
```

### Example 2: Shopping Bill Calculation

```java
double price = 100;
double discount = 10;
double finalPrice = price - (price * discount / 100);
```

### Example 3: Convert Seconds to Minutes and Seconds

```java
int total = 125;
int minutes = total / 60; // 2
int seconds = total % 60; // 5
```



## 11. Common Mistakes

* Assuming `7 / 2` gives `3.5` (integer division returns 3)
* Forgetting to use parentheses for clarity
* Misusing `%` with floating numbers
* Forgetting type casting for `byte` and `short`



## 12. Summary

* Arithmetic operators perform mathematical computations.
* `/` behaves differently for integers and floating-point values.
* `%` gives remainder, useful for patterns, conditions, and cycles.
* Operator precedence affects evaluation order.
* Parentheses help make expressions clearer.

title: HAS-A vs IS-A Relationship
---

## 1. Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) models real-world entities using **relationships** between classes.  
Two fundamental relationships in Java are:

- **IS-A Relationship (Inheritance)**
- **HAS-A Relationship (Composition / Aggregation)**

Understanding these relationships helps you design clean, maintainable, and scalable systems.

## 2. IS-A Relationship (Inheritance)

### Definition

IS-A represents **inheritance**.  
It means one class **is a type of** another class.

Example:

```

Dog IS-A Animal
Car IS-A Vehicle
Manager IS-A Employee

````

In Java, IS-A is implemented using the `extends` keyword.

### Example

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() { }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { }
}
````

Dog **inherits** from Animal.
Therefore, Dog *is an* Animal.



### When to Use IS-A?

Use IS-A when:

* The subclass is a specialized version of the parent class
* The relationship is logically correct
* You want to enable polymorphism and method overriding

Example:

```
Circle IS-A Shape
SavingsAccount IS-A BankAccount
```



### Pitfall: Misusing IS-A

Not every relationship should be inheritance.

Example:

```
Bird IS-A Animal  → correct  
Bird HAS-A Wing   → correct  
Bird IS-A Wing    → incorrect
```



## 3. HAS-A Relationship (Composition / Aggregation)

### Definition

HAS-A means **one class contains another class** as a field.

It represents:

* **Composition** (strong ownership)
* **Aggregation** (weak ownership)

Examples:

```
Car HAS-A Engine  
Library HAS-A Book  
Student HAS-A Address
```

### Example: Composition

```java
class Engine {
    void start() { }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine(); // HAS-A relationship
}
```

Car *has an* Engine.



## 4. Composition vs Aggregation (Under HAS-A)

### 4.1 Composition (Strong HAS-A)

* Child cannot exist without parent
* Lifecycle is tightly dependent
* Example: House HAS-A Room

Code:

```java
class Room { }

class House {
    private Room room = new Room();
}
```

If the House object is destroyed, the Room object is also destroyed.



### 4.2 Aggregation (Weak HAS-A)

* Child can exist independently
* Loose relationship
* Example: Department HAS-A Student

```java
class Student { }

class Department {
    private List<Student> students;
}
```

Students can exist even without a Department.

## 5. Differences Between IS-A and HAS-A

| Feature      | IS-A            | HAS-A                   |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Meaning      | Inheritance     | Composition/Aggregation |
| Keyword      | extends         | Field inside class      |
| Relationship | Parent-child    | Whole-part              |
| Reuse        | Behavior reuse  | Object reuse            |
| Example      | Dog IS-A Animal | Car HAS-A Engine        |



## 6. Real-World Examples

### Example 1 — University System

```
Professor IS-A Employee  
Department HAS-A Professor  
University HAS-A Department
```

### Example 2 — Banking System

```
SavingsAccount IS-A BankAccount  
Customer HAS-A Address  
ATM HAS-A CashDispenser
```

### Example 3 — Applications

```
Button IS-A UIComponent  
Window HAS-A Button  
```

## 7. When to Use Which?

### Use IS-A (Inheritance) when:

* The subclass *is a* special version of the parent class
* You need polymorphism
* You want to override behavior

### Use HAS-A (Composition) when:

* You want to build functionality by combining objects
* Relationship is part-whole
* You want flexibility (composition is more flexible than inheritance)



## 8. Best Practices

* Prefer **HAS-A (composition)** over **IS-A** when possible
  (Composition is more flexible and avoids tight coupling)

* Use inheritance cautiously to avoid deep hierarchies

* Check logical correctness:
  If you can say **X is a Y**, use inheritance.
  If you say **X has a Y**, use composition.



## 9. Summary

* **IS-A** represents inheritance; implemented using `extends`.
* **HAS-A** represents composition/aggregation; implemented using fields.
* IS-A is used for specialization; HAS-A for combining objects.
* Composition is generally preferred over inheritance due to flexibility.
* Understanding both relationships is essential for good object-oriented design.

This completes **HAS-A vs IS-A Relationship in Java**.

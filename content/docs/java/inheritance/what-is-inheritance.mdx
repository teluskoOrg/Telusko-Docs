title: What Is Inheritance
---

## 1. Introduction

Inheritance is one of the core features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
It allows a new class (called **child**, **subclass**, or **derived class**) to **acquire the properties and behaviors** of an existing class (called **parent**, **base**, or **superclass**).

This promotes:

- Code reusability  
- Polymorphism  
- Cleaner design  
- Better maintainability  

In Java, inheritance is implemented using the `extends` keyword.

## 2. Definition of Inheritance

**Inheritance** is the mechanism in Java where one class **inherits** fields and methods of another class.

### Syntax:

```java
class Child extends Parent {
    // new properties and methods
}
````

Here:

* `Parent` → superclass
* `Child` → subclass

The child class automatically gets:

* All **non-private** fields
* All **non-private** methods



## 3. Simple Example of Inheritance

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.eat();  // inherited from Animal
        d.bark(); // own method
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Animal eats
Dog barks
```

The `Dog` class inherited the `eat()` method from `Animal`.

## 4. Key Terminology

### 4.1 Superclass (Parent Class)

The class whose properties are inherited.

### 4.2 Subclass (Child Class)

The class that inherits properties from the parent.

### 4.3 Inheritance Hierarchy

Structure showing parent-child relationships.

Example:

```
Fruit
 ├── Mango
 ├── Apple
 └── Orange
```

### 4.4 IS-A Relationship

Inheritance must satisfy an **IS-A** relationship:

* A Dog **is an** Animal
* A Car **is a** Vehicle

If the relationship doesn't make logical sense, inheritance should not be used.



## 5. What Gets Inherited?

A subclass inherits:

* All **non-private fields**
* All **non-private methods**
* All **protected members**
* Default members (if in same package)

It does **not** inherit:

* Constructors
* Private fields/methods
* Static methods (they are accessible but not inherited)
* Final methods cannot be overridden



## 6. Accessing Superclass Members

The subclass can access superclass members (except private ones):

```java
class A {
    protected int value = 10;
}

class B extends A {
    void display() {
        System.out.println(value); // allowed
    }
}
```

Private members are accessible only via:

* Getters/setters
* Public methods



## 7. Constructor Behavior in Inheritance

Constructors are **not inherited**, but when a subclass is created, the superclass constructor is called automatically.

Example:

```java
class A {
    A() {
        System.out.println("Parent Constructor");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    B() {
        System.out.println("Child Constructor");
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Parent Constructor
Child Constructor
```



## 8. Real-World Examples of Inheritance

### 8.1 Vehicles

```
Vehicle
 ├── Car
 ├── Bike
 └── Truck
```

All vehicles have:

* start()
* stop()

Each subclass extends behavior.

### 8.2 Application Users

```
User
 ├── Admin
 ├── Guest
 └── RegisteredUser
```

Shared properties: id, name, login()

## 9. Why Inheritance Matters

| Benefit         | Description                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Reusability     | Use superclass code in subclasses                  |
| Maintainability | Fixing a bug in superclass fixes all subclasses    |
| Extensibility   | Add new subclasses without modifying existing code |
| Polymorphism    | Enables method overriding and dynamic dispatch     |



## 10. Summary

* Inheritance allows one class to derive properties and methods from another.
* Implemented using the `extends` keyword.
* Supports **IS-A** relationship.
* Subclasses inherit all non-private members of the parent.
* Provides foundation for **polymorphism** and **overriding**.
* Helps in designing structured, reusable, and maintainable code.

This completes **What Is Inheritance**.

title: Upcasting and Downcasting
---
## 1. Introduction

When working with inheritance, Java allows you to treat an object of a subclass as if it were an object of its parent class.  
This is known as **type casting in inheritance**, and it is divided into:

- **Upcasting** → Casting child to parent (safe)  
- **Downcasting** → Casting parent to child (requires explicit cast, not always safe)

Casting plays a major role in **polymorphism**, **method overriding**, and **runtime object handling**.

## 2. Upcasting (Child → Parent)

### Definition

Upcasting means assigning a child object to a parent reference.

```java
Parent p = new Child(); // upcasting
````

### Why Upcasting Is Safe?

* A child **is-a** parent (IS-A relationship)
* Child object contains everything the parent has
* No explicit cast required

### Example

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
    @Override
    void sound() { System.out.println("Dog sound"); }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog(); // upcasting
        a.sound();            // Dog sound (polymorphism)
    }
}
```

Upcasting allows **runtime polymorphism** — the child method overrides the parent method.



### Limitations of Upcasting

```java
Animal a = new Dog();
a.bark();   // ERROR: bark() not accessible
```

Because the reference type controls what you can access.

## 3. Downcasting (Parent → Child)

### Definition

Downcasting means assigning a parent reference to a child reference.

```java
Child c = (Child) p; // downcasting
```

### Important:

* Requires **explicit cast**
* Not always safe
* Can throw **ClassCastException** at runtime
* Should only be done when the object is truly of the child type

### Example

```java
Animal a = new Dog(); // upcast
Dog d = (Dog) a;      // downcast (safe)
d.bark();             // works
```

### Unsafe Downcasting Example

```java
Animal a = new Animal();
Dog d = (Dog) a; // ERROR at runtime: ClassCastException
```

Because the actual object is **not** a Dog.



## 4. Checking Safe Downcasting Using instanceof

Before downcasting, always check:

```java
if (a instanceof Dog) {
    Dog d = (Dog) a;
    d.bark();
}
```

Output:

```
Bark
```

This avoids runtime exceptions.

## 5. Upcasting + Downcasting in Polymorphism

### Example

```java
Animal a = new Dog(); // upcasting
Dog d = (Dog) a;      // downcasting
d.bark();
```

Upcasting gives the object a parent reference;
Downcasting restores the child-specific features.



## 6. Real-World Example

### Example: Payment System

```java
class Payment {
    void pay() {
        System.out.println("General payment");
    }
}

class CreditCard extends Payment {
    void creditOffer() {
        System.out.println("Special credit card offer");
    }
}
```

Usage:

```java
Payment p = new CreditCard(); // upcasting
p.pay();

CreditCard c = (CreditCard) p; // downcasting
c.creditOffer();
```



## 7. Differences Between Upcasting and Downcasting

| Feature                 | Upcasting           | Downcasting           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Direction               | Child → Parent      | Parent → Child        |
| Explicit cast required? | No                  | Yes                   |
| Safety                  | Always safe         | Not always safe       |
| Access                  | Parent methods only | Child methods too     |
| Purpose                 | Polymorphism        | Regain child features |



## 8. Summary

* **Upcasting** is safe and automatic; enables polymorphism.
* **Downcasting** is explicit and risky; must ensure type compatibility.
* `instanceof` should be used to prevent ClassCastException.
* Upcasting restricts access to parent-level features; downcasting restores child-specific methods.

This completes **Upcasting and Downcasting in Java**.

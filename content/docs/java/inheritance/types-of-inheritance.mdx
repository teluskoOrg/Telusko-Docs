title: Types of Inheritance
---

## 1. Introduction

Inheritance allows classes to acquire properties and behaviors of other classes.  
Java supports several forms of inheritance, but **not all** types seen in other OOP languages (like C++).

Understanding different types of inheritance helps in designing clear and logical class structures.



## 2. Types of Inheritance

Java supports the following types:

1. **Single Inheritance**  
2. **Multilevel Inheritance**  
3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**  
4. **Hybrid Inheritance** (Supported through interfaces)

Java does **not** support:

- **Multiple inheritance through classes**  
  (to avoid ambiguity known as the “diamond problem”)

Let’s explore each supported type in detail.



## 3. Single Inheritance

A class inherits from only one parent class.

```

A
│
└── B

````

Example:

```java
class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("A show");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("B display");
    }
}
````

Here, class B inherits from class A.



## 4. Multilevel Inheritance

A class is derived from another subclass, forming a chain.

```
A
│
└── B
    │
    └── C
```

Example:

```java
class A {
    void m1() { }
}

class B extends A {
    void m2() { }
}

class C extends B {
    void m3() { }
}
```

Class C inherits from B and indirectly from A.

## 5. Hierarchical Inheritance

Multiple classes inherit from the same parent class.

```
        A
      / | \
     B  C  D
```

Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() { }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
}

class Cat extends Animal {
}

class Horse extends Animal {
}
```

All subclasses share common methods from `Animal`.



## 6. Hybrid Inheritance

Hybrid inheritance is a **combination** of two or more types of inheritance.

Java **supports hybrid inheritance using interfaces**, not classes.

Example:

```
   A         Interface X
   │            │
   B            │
    \          /
         C
```

Example with interfaces:

```java
interface X {
    void m1();
}

class A {
    void m2() { }
}

class B extends A implements X {
    public void m1() { }
}
```

Java prevents multiple inheritance of classes to avoid ambiguity but allows hybrid patterns using interfaces.



## 7. Multiple Inheritance (Not Supported in Classes)

Java does not allow:

```java
class C extends A, B; // ERROR
```

Reason: **Diamond Problem**

If both A and B have the same method, the JVM cannot decide which version C should inherit.

Java solves this by:

* Allowing multiple inheritance through **interfaces**, not classes.

## 8. Summary Table of Inheritance Types

| Type         | Supported in Java (Classes) | Supported via Interfaces | Description                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Single       | Yes                         | Yes                      | One parent, one child          |
| Multilevel   | Yes                         | Yes                      | Chain of inheritance           |
| Hierarchical | Yes                         | Yes                      | One parent, many children      |
| Hybrid       | No                          | Yes                      | Combination (using interfaces) |
| Multiple     | No                          | Yes                      | Supported only via interfaces  |



## 9. Real-World Examples

### Single Inheritance

```
Vehicle → Car
```

### Multilevel Inheritance

```
Person → Employee → Manager
```

### Hierarchical Inheritance

```
Account → SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount, LoanAccount
```

### Hybrid Inheritance (via interfaces)

```
Drivable, Electric → ElectricCar
```



## 10. Summary

* Java supports **single, multilevel, hierarchical**, and **hybrid (via interfaces)** inheritance.
* Java does **not** support multiple inheritance of classes to avoid ambiguity.
* Interfaces provide flexibility for hybrid and multi-type inheritance.
* Understanding these forms helps in designing cleaner class structures and relationships.

This completes **Types of Inheritance in Java**.

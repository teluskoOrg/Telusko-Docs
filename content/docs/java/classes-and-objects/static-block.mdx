title: Static Block
---

## 1. Introduction

In Java, a **static block** (also called a static initialization block) is a special block of code that runs **automatically when the class is loaded into the JVM**, before any object is created and even before the `main()` method runs.

Static blocks are used to:

- Initialize static variables  
- Perform class-level setup  
- Load configurations  
- Execute code only once for the entire program  

Understanding static blocks is essential for mastering class loading, static initialization, and JVM behavior.

## 2. What Is a Static Block?

A static block is declared using the `static` keyword:

```java
static {
    // code here
}
```

### Key Characteristics

* Executes **only once** when the class is loaded
* Runs **before main()**
* Used for static initialization
* Executes **in the order they appear** if multiple static blocks exist

### Example

```java
class Demo {
    static {
        System.out.println("Static Block Executed");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main Method Executed");
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Static Block Executed
Main Method Executed
```

Static block runs first because class loading happens before main().

## 3. Why Use Static Blocks?

Static blocks are useful when you need:

### 3.1 Complex Initialization of Static Variables

Example:

```java
static int data;

static {
    data = 10 * 5;  // complex calculation
}
```

### 3.2 Loading Configuration Files

Example:

```java
static Properties config = new Properties();

static {
    config.load(new FileInputStream("config.properties"));
}
```

### 3.3 Initializing static final variables

```java
static final int MAX;

static {
    MAX = 100;  // allowed for final variables
}
```

### 3.4 Calling static helper methods during class load



## 4. Multiple Static Blocks

Java allows multiple static blocks.
Execution happens **top to bottom**, in the order they appear.

```java
class Test {
    static {
        System.out.println("Block 1");
    }

    static {
        System.out.println("Block 2");
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Block 1
Block 2
```

## 5. Static Block vs Static Method

| Feature           | Static Block    | Static Method    |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Runs when         | Class is loaded | Method is called |
| How many times?   | Once            | Multiple times   |
| Accept arguments? | No              | Yes              |
| Return something? | No              | Yes              |
| Purpose           | Initialization  | Reusable logic   |

Static blocks are intended for one-time setup only.

## 6. Static Block with Object Creation

Even if no objects are created, static blocks still run.

```java
class A {
    static {
        System.out.println("Static Block of A");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // No object created
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Static Block of A
```

Because class A was loaded.



## 7. Static Block and Class.forName()

Static blocks also run when the class is loaded dynamically using `Class.forName()`.

```java
Class.forName("Test");
```

This causes the static block inside `Test` to execute immediately.



## 8. Using Static Blocks to Load Native Libraries

```java
static {
    System.loadLibrary("mylib");
}
```

This ensures the library is loaded only once.



## 9. Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Trying to access instance variables

Static block cannot access non-static variables:

```java
int x = 10;

static {
    System.out.println(x); // ERROR
}
```

### Mistake 2: Using static blocks unnecessarily

If simple assignment works, no need for a static block.

### Mistake 3: Expecting static block to run multiple times

It runs **only once** per class loading.



## 10. Complete Example Demonstrating Static Block Behavior

```java
class DatabaseConnection {

    static String url;
    static String username;
    static String password;

    static {
        System.out.println("Loading configuration...");
        url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost/test";
        username = "root";
        password = "1234";
    }

    static void connect() {
        System.out.println("Connecting to " + url);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DatabaseConnection.connect();
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Loading configuration...
Connecting to jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
```



## 11. Summary

* Static blocks execute **once** when the class loads.
* They run **before main()** and before any object creation.
* Used for initializing static variables and configurations.
* Multiple static blocks execute in order.
* Cannot access instance members.
* Useful for complex initialization and setup tasks.

This completes **Static Block in Java**.

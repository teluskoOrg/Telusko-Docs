title: What Is String?
---

## 1. Introduction

In Java, a **String** is one of the most commonly used classes.  
It represents a sequence of characters and is widely used in almost every Java program. Whether you're handling user input, displaying messages, or manipulating text, you'll use strings constantly.

Strings are **immutable**, meaning that once a string is created, its value cannot be changed. This immutability ensures security and efficiency when working with strings in Java.



## 2. What Exactly Is a String?

A **String** is an object that represents a **sequence of characters**.  
In Java, strings are instances of the `java.lang.String` class, and they are **immutable** by design, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created.

Example:

```java
String greeting = "Hello, world!";
````

Here, `"Hello, world!"` is a string literal, and the `greeting` variable holds a reference to it.



## 3. String Creation: Literal vs Constructor

In Java, you can create strings in two ways:

1. **Using string literals**:

   * These are directly assigned to variables.
   * Java maintains a special area in memory called the **string pool** to reuse string literals.

   Example:

   ```java
   String str1 = "Hello";
   String str2 = "Hello";
   ```

   * In this case, both `str1` and `str2` refer to the same string object in the string pool, and no new memory is allocated for the second `"Hello"`.

2. **Using the `new` keyword**:

   * You can explicitly create new string objects using the `new` keyword, but this creates a new object in memory.

   Example:

   ```java
   String str3 = new String("Hello");
   ```

   * Even though the string literal `"Hello"` exists in the string pool, this creates a **new instance** on the heap, not using the pool.



## 4. String Immutability

The key characteristic of the `String` class is **immutability**.
Once a string is created, you **cannot modify its value** directly. Instead, operations on strings produce new strings.

For example:

```java
String s = "Hello";
s = s + " world!";
```

Here, `"Hello"` and `" world!"` are concatenated to form a new string.
The original string `"Hello"` is not modified. Instead, a new string `"Hello world!"` is created and assigned to `s`.



## 5. String Pool and String Interning

Java optimizes string memory by storing string literals in a **string pool**.
When you create a string literal, Java checks if that string already exists in the pool. If it does, it uses the same reference, avoiding redundant memory usage.

```java
String a = "Hello";
String b = "Hello";
```

* Both `a` and `b` refer to the same object in the string pool.

You can **explicitly intern** strings to add them to the pool using the `intern()` method:

```java
String str1 = new String("Hello");
String str2 = str1.intern(); // Adds to string pool
```



## 6. String Methods and Manipulations

The `String` class provides many useful methods for working with strings, such as:

* `length()`: Returns the length of the string.

  ```java
  String s = "Hello";
  int len = s.length(); // 5
  ```

* `charAt()`: Returns the character at a specific index.

  ```java
  char ch = s.charAt(1); // 'e'
  ```

* `substring()`: Returns a part of the string.

  ```java
  String sub = s.substring(1, 4); // "ell"
  ```

* `equals()`: Checks if two strings are equal.

  ```java
  boolean isEqual = s.equals("Hello"); // true
  ```

* `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`: Converts the string to upper or lower case.

  ```java
  String upper = s.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO"
  ```



## 7. StringBuilder vs String

While `String` is immutable, **`StringBuilder`** is a mutable alternative that is more efficient when performing many string manipulations, especially inside loops.

### Example: Using `StringBuilder` for String Concatenation

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb.append(" world!");
System.out.println(sb.toString()); // "Hello world!"
```

Unlike `String`, `StringBuilder` modifies the existing object instead of creating new objects each time. This makes it more memory and time efficient for certain operations.



## 8. String vs StringBuffer

`StringBuffer` is another mutable alternative to `String`, similar to `StringBuilder`.
The primary difference is that `StringBuffer` is **synchronized**, making it thread-safe but slower than `StringBuilder`.

For most cases, if thread-safety is not a concern, **`StringBuilder`** is preferred for performance.



## 9. String Comparison

You compare strings using `equals()` method (not `==`):

* `==` compares memory references (addresses), not the actual contents.
* `equals()` compares the **contents** of the strings.

Example:

```java
String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = "Hello";

System.out.println(s1 == s2);        // true (same reference)
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));   // true (same content)
```

If you use `new String()`:

```java
String s1 = new String("Hello");
String s2 = new String("Hello");

System.out.println(s1 == s2);        // false (different memory references)
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));   // true (same content)
```



## 10. Common Mistakes

### 10.1 Using `==` to compare string content

As mentioned, `==` checks for **reference equality**, not **content equality**.
Always use `.equals()` to compare string content.

### 10.2 Modifying strings (thinking they're mutable)

Strings are immutable. Be aware that operations on strings like concatenation or replacing characters will create new strings rather than modifying the original.

 

## 11. Summary

* A **String** is an object in Java that represents a sequence of characters and is **immutable**.
* Strings can be created using literals or the `new` keyword, with literals being stored in a **string pool** for optimization.
* String operations like concatenation create new objects because of immutability.
* **StringBuilder** and **StringBuffer** are mutable alternatives used for more efficient string manipulation in cases where multiple changes are needed.
* Always use `.equals()` for string comparison, not `==`.

title: Anonymous Object
---

## 1. Introduction

An **anonymous object** in Java is an object that is **created without storing its reference in a variable**.

Example:

```java
new Student().show();
```

Here:

* The object is created
* A method is called on it immediately
* The object becomes **eligible for garbage collection** after the statement ends

Anonymous objects are useful when:

* You need a one-time object
* You don't want to reuse the object
* You want clean, compact code

They are commonly used in:

* Method calling
* Passing objects as arguments
* Anonymous inner classes
* Event handling (especially in GUI frameworks)

## 2. What Is an Anonymous Object?

A normal object:

```java
Student s = new Student();
s.show();
```

Anonymous object:

```java
new Student().show();
```

Difference:

| Normal Object             | Anonymous Object           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Has reference variable    | Has no reference           |
| Can be reused             | Cannot be reused           |
| Stored until out of scope | Immediately becomes unused |
| Uses more code            | Short and clean            |

## 3. When Should You Use Anonymous Objects?

Use them when:

1. You only need the object **once**
2. You want compact code
3. The object does not need reuse
4. You are calling **one or very few methods**

Example:

```java
new Scanner(System.in).nextInt();
```

This Scanner object is created and directly used without a variable.

## 4. Anonymous Object Example — Method Call

```java
class Demo {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Display method called");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Demo().display();  // anonymous object
    }
}
```

The object is used once and discarded.

## 5. Anonymous Object Passed as an Argument

```java
class Test {
    void show(Student s) {
        System.out.println("Student object received");
    }
}

new Test().show(new Student());
```

No variable is created for the `Student` object.

## 6. Anonymous Object with Constructor

Used when constructors perform important initialization.

```java
new Car("Honda", 2024);
```

Even if no methods are called, the constructor runs and initializes the object.

## 7. Anonymous Objects and Arrays

You can create anonymous arrays as arguments.

```java
show(new int[] {10, 20, 30});
```

A full array object is created without storing it.

## 8. Anonymous Inner Classes (Very Important)

Anonymous objects are heavily used in **anonymous inner classes**, especially in GUI, threads, and event handling.

Example:

```java
Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running");
    }
});
t.start();
```

Here, `new Runnable() {...}` is an **anonymous object** of an anonymous class.

## 9. Anonymous Object vs Named Object

| Feature                   | Named Object                             | Anonymous Object |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Has reference variable    | No variable                              |                  |
| Can call multiple methods | One-time use                             |                  |
| Lives longer              | Short-lived                              |                  |
| Used in full programs     | Mostly used for arguments or quick tasks |                  |


## 10. Anonymous Object and Garbage Collection

Anonymous objects are not stored in any reference.
So they become **eligible for garbage collection immediately** after use.

Example:

```java
new Demo();
```

Since it's not stored, nothing points to it → GC collects it sooner.

## 11. Real-World Uses

### 11.1 Singleton-like operations

```java
new Logger().log("start");
```

### 11.2 Reading input

```java
int age = new Scanner(System.in).nextInt();
```

### 11.3 Comparing values

```java
new Integer(10).compareTo(20);
```

### 11.4 GUI Click Handlers

```java
button.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {
    public void onClick() {
        System.out.println("Clicked");
    }
});
```

## 12. Complete Example Demonstrating Anonymous Objects

```java
class MathOp {
    int square(int n) {
        return n * n;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = new MathOp().square(5); // anonymous object
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
25
```

## 13. Summary

* Anonymous objects are created without reference variables.
* Used when an object is needed **once**.
* Saves memory (short-lived).
* Cannot be reused.
* Useful for method calls, passing arguments, and anonymous inner classes.
* Becomes immediately eligible for garbage collection after use.

This completes **Anonymous Object in Java**.

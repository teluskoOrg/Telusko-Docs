## 1. Introduction

An **inner class** in Java is a class that is **defined within another class**.  
It is used to represent a **close relationship** between two classes and can access the private members of its outer class.  

Inner classes are a powerful feature in Java, allowing you to logically group classes, improve code readability, and encapsulate functionality.  
There are different types of inner classes, each serving different use cases:

- **Regular inner class**
- **Local inner class**
- **Anonymous inner class**
- **Static nested class**

This lecture covers the basics and uses of each type of inner class.



## 2. Regular Inner Class (Non-static Inner Class)

A **regular inner class** (non-static nested class) is a class defined inside another class.  
It has access to all the members (including private) of its enclosing class.

Example:

```java
class Outer {
    private String message = "Hello from Outer class";

    class Inner {
        void display() {
            System.out.println(message);  // Accesses outer class member
        }
    }

    public void show() {
        Inner inner = new Inner();
        inner.display();
    }
}
````

Usage:

```java
Outer outer = new Outer();
outer.show();  // Output: Hello from Outer class
```



## 3. Why Use Inner Classes?

### 3.1 Grouping Related Classes

Inner classes are useful when a class logically depends on the outer class, and grouping them together improves readability.

Example:

* `List` and `Iterator`
* `GUI components` like `Button`, `ActionListener`

### 3.2 Accessing Private Members

Inner classes can access **private members** of the outer class, making them a powerful tool for tight coupling between related functionality.



## 4. Local Inner Class (Defined Inside Method)

A **local inner class** is an inner class that is **defined within a method**.
It is useful when you want to define a class that is only used within a specific method, making the class tightly scoped.

Example:

```java
class Outer {
    void outerMethod() {
        class LocalInner {
            void show() {
                System.out.println("Inside local inner class");
            }
        }
        LocalInner inner = new LocalInner();
        inner.show();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer outer = new Outer();
        outer.outerMethod();  // Output: Inside local inner class
    }
}
```

Important:

* Local inner classes cannot be declared `static`.
* They can access **final** or **effectively final** local variables from the enclosing method.



## 5. Anonymous Inner Class (Inline Class)

An **anonymous inner class** is a class without a name, defined directly in a method call or assignment.
It is typically used when you want to override a method or implement an interface without creating a separate class.

Example:

```java
interface Greeting {
    void sayHello();
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Greeting g = new Greeting() {  // Anonymous inner class
            public void sayHello() {
                System.out.println("Hello from Anonymous class");
            }
        };
        g.sayHello();  // Output: Hello from Anonymous class
    }
}
```

Use case:

* Implementing an interface or overriding methods in a compact way.
* Particularly useful for **event handling** in GUI applications (e.g., button click listeners).



## 6. Static Nested Class

A **static nested class** is an inner class that is **static**.
Unlike regular inner classes, static nested classes do not have access to the outer class’s instance variables and methods. They can only access the **static members** of the outer class.

Example:

```java
class Outer {
    private static String message = "Hello from static outer class";

    static class StaticNested {
        void display() {
            System.out.println(message);  // Accesses static member of outer class
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer.StaticNested nested = new Outer.StaticNested();
        nested.display();  // Output: Hello from static outer class
    }
}
```

Static nested classes are useful when:

* You need to create a helper class that does not need to access the instance fields of the outer class.
* You want to logically group related classes together.



## 7. Comparison of Inner Classes

| Feature               | Regular Inner Class                        | Local Inner Class                                     | Anonymous Inner Class                                 | Static Nested Class                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Access to Outer Class | Can access all members, even private       | Can access final or effectively final local variables | Can access final or effectively final local variables | Can access only static members of the outer class |
| Instance/Static       | Instance-based                             | Instance-based                                        | Instance-based                                        | Static-based                                      |
| Use Case              | Group related classes, use private members | Scoped to a method, temporary class                   | Inline method or interface implementation             | Helper class, does not need outer class instance  |



## 8. When to Use Each Type of Inner Class?

* **Regular Inner Class**: When the inner class logically depends on the outer class and needs access to its private members.
* **Local Inner Class**: When you need a class that is only used within a specific method.
* **Anonymous Inner Class**: When you need a one-off class to implement an interface or override a method without creating a separate class.
* **Static Nested Class**: When the inner class does not need access to instance fields or methods and can be logically grouped with the outer class.



## 9. Common Mistakes

### 9.1 Trying to use `this` in local/anonymous inner classes

Local and anonymous inner classes do not allow the use of `this` to refer to the outer class.
Use `OuterClassName.this` to access the outer class.

```java
class Outer {
    void outerMethod() {
        class LocalInner {
            void show() {
                System.out.println(Outer.this);  // Accessing outer class instance
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 9.2 Creating anonymous inner classes for large implementations

Anonymous inner classes should be used for small, short implementations.
For larger logic, prefer a named inner class or regular class.



## 10. Summary

* Inner classes allow you to logically group related classes and encapsulate functionality.
* Different types of inner classes serve different purposes:

  * **Regular inner class**: tightly coupled with the outer class
  * **Local inner class**: temporary class inside a method
  * **Anonymous inner class**: one-off class implementation
  * **Static nested class**: static class within an outer class
* Inner classes help improve readability and encapsulate behavior that belongs together.

title: Method Local Inner Class
---

## 1. Introduction

A **method-local inner class** is a type of inner class that is defined **inside a method**.  
It is **scoped** to the method in which it is defined and can be used only within that method.

Method-local inner classes are useful when you need to define a class that is **specific to one method's functionality**. They allow for better encapsulation and readability, as the class is closely tied to the logic of the method.



## 2. What Is a Method Local Inner Class?

A method-local inner class is an inner class that is declared **inside a method**.

Example:

```java
class Outer {
    void outerMethod() {
        class Inner {
            void display() {
                System.out.println("Inside inner class");
            }
        }

        Inner inner = new Inner();
        inner.display();
    }
}
````

Here, `Inner` is defined inside `outerMethod()`, and it can only be used within that method.



## 3. Characteristics of Method Local Inner Class

* It can access **local variables** of the method, **but only if those variables are `final`** (or effectively final in Java 8+).
* It can access **instance variables** and **methods** of the outer class, just like regular inner classes.
* It has a **method-level scope**, meaning it cannot be accessed outside the method it is defined in.



## 4. Example: Using Method Local Inner Class

```java
class Outer {
    void displayMessage(String msg) {
        class Inner {
            void printMessage() {
                System.out.println("Message: " + msg);
            }
        }

        Inner inner = new Inner();
        inner.printMessage();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Outer outer = new Outer();
        outer.displayMessage("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Message: Hello, world!
```

Here, `Inner` class is scoped to `displayMessage` method and cannot be used outside that method.



## 5. Accessing Final or Effectively Final Local Variables

Method-local inner classes can **access local variables** of the method, but they must be **final** or **effectively final**.

Example:

```java
class Outer {
    void outerMethod() {
        final int number = 5;

        class Inner {
            void printNumber() {
                System.out.println(number);
            }
        }

        Inner inner = new Inner();
        inner.printNumber();
    }
}
```

Here, `number` is `final`, so it can be accessed by the inner class.
In Java 8+, you don't need to explicitly declare the variable as `final`, as long as it is not modified after initialization (effectively final).



## 6. When to Use Method Local Inner Class?

Method-local inner classes are useful in scenarios where:

* You want a class that is **closely tied** to a single method.
* The class does not need to be reused outside of the method.
* You need to **encapsulate logic** within the method to improve readability.

They are often used in event-driven programming or when the class will only be used for a single specific task.



## 7. Scope of Method Local Inner Class

Since method-local inner classes are defined inside a method, their scope is limited to that method.
They **cannot** be used outside of the method, meaning:

* They cannot be returned or passed around.
* They cannot be accessed by other methods in the outer class.

Example of invalid access:

```java
class Outer {
    void outerMethod() {
        class Inner {
            void display() {
                System.out.println("Inside Inner");
            }
        }

        Inner inner = new Inner();
        inner.display();
    }

    void anotherMethod() {
        // Inner inner = new Inner(); // Error: cannot access Inner class
    }
}
```



## 8. Method Local Inner Class vs Regular Inner Class

| Feature                     | Method Local Inner Class                                          | Regular Inner Class                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope                       | Limited to the method                                             | Can be accessed anywhere within the enclosing class   |
| Access to outer class       | Can access outer class instance variables and methods             | Can access outer class instance variables and methods |
| Access to local variables   | Can access local variables if they are final or effectively final | Cannot access local variables directly                |
| Can be instantiated outside | No                                                                | Yes                                                   |



## 9. Example Use Case: Button Click Handler in GUI

In GUI programming, method-local inner classes are often used to handle events, such as button clicks.

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;

public class ButtonClickExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Button Click Example");
        JButton button = new JButton("Click Me");

        button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                System.out.println("Button Clicked");
            }
        });

        frame.add(button);
        frame.setSize(200, 200);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

In this example, the anonymous inner class (which is a form of method-local class) is used to handle button clicks. Similarly, you can define custom logic within methods for handling UI interactions.



## 10. Common Mistakes

### 10.1 Trying to use non-final local variables

```java
class Outer {
    void outerMethod() {
        int number = 5; // Non-final variable

        class Inner {
            void printNumber() {
                System.out.println(number); // Error: local variables must be final or effectively final
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 10.2 Misunderstanding method-local class scope

```java
class Outer {
    void outerMethod() {
        class Inner {
            void show() {
                System.out.println("Inside inner class");
            }
        }

        Inner inner = new Inner();
        inner.show();
    }

    void anotherMethod() {
        // Cannot create Inner class here as it's scoped to outerMethod
    }
}
```


## 11. Summary

* Method-local inner classes are defined inside a method and scoped only to that method.
* They can access the outer class’s instance variables and methods, but only final or effectively final local variables from the enclosing method.
* These classes are useful for logic that is tightly scoped to a method.
* They cannot be instantiated or accessed outside the method.

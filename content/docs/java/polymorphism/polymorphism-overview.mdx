title: Polymorphism Overview

## 1. Introduction

Polymorphism is one of the most important pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
The word **polymorphism** means *many forms*.

In Java, polymorphism allows:

- A single reference type to refer to objects of different classes  
- A method to behave differently depending on the object that calls it  
- Flexible and extendable program design  

Polymorphism makes Java applications more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.



## 2. Types of Polymorphism in Java

Java supports two types of polymorphism:

1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Binding / Method Overloading)**  
2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding / Method Overriding)**  



## 3. Compile-Time vs Runtime Polymorphism

### 3.1 Compile-Time Polymorphism  
Achieved through **method overloading**.

- Method to call is decided at compile time  
- Same method name, different parameters  

Example:

```java
void sum(int a, int b) {}
void sum(double a, double b) {}
````



### 3.2 Runtime Polymorphism

Achieved through **method overriding**.

* Method to call is decided at runtime
* Overridden method in subclass replaces parent method
* Uses **upcasting** and **dynamic method dispatch**

Example:

```java
class A { void show() { } }
class B extends A { @Override void show() { } }
A obj = new B(); // runtime selection
```


## 4. Why Do We Need Polymorphism?

### 4.1 Flexibility and Extensibility

You can write general code that works with multiple types.

Example:

```java
Animal a = new Dog();
a.sound();

a = new Cat();
a.sound();
```

Same reference, different behaviors.



### 4.2 Cleaner and Maintainable Code

Without polymorphism:

* You would write repetitive `if-else` or `switch` statements
* Code becomes harder to modify

With polymorphism:

Add new subclasses without modifying existing logic.



### 4.3 Supports Frameworks and Abstractions

Every major Java framework (Spring, Hibernate, JDBC) heavily uses polymorphism.

Example: JDBC

```java
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(...);
```

`Connection` is an interface, implemented by many drivers — polymorphism hides implementation.



## 5. Real-World Example of Polymorphism

### Payment System

```java
class Payment {
    void pay() { }
}

class CreditCard extends Payment {
    void pay() { System.out.println("Paid using Credit Card"); }
}

class UPI extends Payment {
    void pay() { System.out.println("Paid using UPI"); }
}
```

Usage:

```java
Payment p = new CreditCard();
p.pay(); // Paid using Credit Card

p = new UPI();
p.pay(); // Paid using UPI
```

The same reference produces different outcomes.



## 6. Method Overriding and Polymorphism

Overriding allows a subclass to provide specific behavior:

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}
```

Polymorphism ensures:

```java
Animal a = new Dog();
a.sound();  // Dog barks
```

Runtime selects correct method.



## 7. Polymorphism and Interfaces

Interfaces allow unrelated classes to share common behavior.

Example:

```java
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() { System.out.println("Draw Circle"); }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    public void draw() { System.out.println("Draw Square"); }
}
```

Usage:

```java
Shape s = new Circle();
s.draw();

s = new Square();
s.draw();
```


## 8. Advantages of Polymorphism

* Improves code reusability
* Reduces code duplication
* Enhances program extensibility
* Promotes loose coupling
* Enables interface-based programming
* Foundation of design patterns (Strategy, Command, Factory)



## 9. Summary

* Polymorphism means *many forms*.
* Java supports compile-time (overloading) and runtime (overriding) polymorphism.
* Runtime polymorphism is implemented using inheritance and method overriding.
* Allows a single reference type to refer to different object types.
* Essential for flexible, maintainable, and scalable application design.

This completes **Polymorphism Overview**.

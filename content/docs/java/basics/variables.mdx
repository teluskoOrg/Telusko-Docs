## 1. Introduction

Variables are the basic building blocks of any Java program.  
A variable acts as a **container** that stores data during program execution.

In Java:

- Every variable has a **name**
- Every variable has a **data type**
- Every variable has a **value** (assigned later or during declaration)
- Every variable has a **scope**

Understanding variables is essential because **all logic, input, output, loops, and functions revolve around using variables correctly**.

## 2. What Is a Variable?

A variable is a memory location with a name, used to store data.

Example:

```java
int age = 20;
```

Here:

* `int` → data type
* `age` → variable name
* `20` → value stored in memory


## 3. How Variables Work in Memory

When you declare a variable, the JVM allocates a specific amount of memory based on the data type.

For example:

* `int` → 4 bytes
* `double` → 8 bytes
* `char` → 2 bytes

## 4. Types of Variables in Java

Java supports **three main types of variables**:

### 4.1 Local Variables

* Declared **inside a method**, constructor, or block.
* Must be **initialized** before use.
* Stored in **stack memory**.
* Accessible only within that block.

![variables](/images/java/variable2.png)

Example:

```java
void display() {
    int age = 20; // local variable
    System.out.println(age);
}
```

You cannot access `age` outside the `display()` method.


### 4.2 Instance Variables (Non-static variables)

* Declared **inside a class**, but **outside any method**.
* Each object gets its own copy.
* Stored in **heap memory**.

Example:

```java
class Student {
    int age; // instance variable
}
```

Each object has its own `age`.


### 4.3 Static Variables (Class variables)

* Declared using the `static` keyword.
* Only **one copy** shared by all objects.
* Stored in **method area** of JVM.

Example:

```java
class Student {
    static String schoolName = "ABC School";
}
```

All `Student` objects share this same school name.

## 5. Declaring Variables

Syntax:

```java
data_type variable_name;
```

or with initialization:

```java
data_type variable_name = value;
```

Examples:

```java
int number = 10;
double price = 99.99;
char grade = 'A';
boolean isActive = true;
```

## 6. Rules for Naming Variables

Java follows specific naming conventions:

* Must start with a **letter**, `_`, or `$`
* Cannot start with a digit
* Cannot contain spaces or special symbols
* Cannot use Java keywords (`class`, `public`, etc.)

### Recommended Naming Style (camelCase)

Examples:

```java
int studentAge;
double accountBalance;
boolean isVerified;
```

Bad examples:

```java
int StudentAge;   // starts with uppercase (looks like a class)
int a;            // meaningless name
int student_age;  // not preferred in Java style
```

## 7. Variable Initialization

### Proper initialization:

```java
int x = 5;
```

### Uninitialized local variable (Error):

```java
int x;
System.out.println(x); // ERROR: x is not initialized
```

But instance/static variables get **default values**:

| Type    | Default Value |
| ------- | ------------- |
| int     | 0             |
| double  | 0.0           |
| boolean | false         |
| Object  | null          |

## 8. Variable Scope

Scope defines where a variable can be accessed.

### Local Variable Scope

```java
if (true) {
    int n = 10; // available only inside this block
}
System.out.println(n); // ERROR
```

### Instance Variable Scope

```java
class A {
    int x = 10; // accessible by all methods of class A
}
```

### Static Variable Scope

Accessible anywhere using:

```java
ClassName.variableName
```

## 9. Variable Lifetime

* **Local variables** → created when method starts, destroyed when method ends.
* **Instance variables** → exist as long as the object exists.
* **Static variables** → exist as long as the program/JVM is running.


## 10. Examples

### Complete Example Using All Variable Types

```java
class Car {

    // static variable
    static String manufacturer = "Toyota";

    // instance variable
    String model;

    void displayModel() {
        // local variable
        String message = "The model is: ";
        System.out.println(message + model);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car c = new Car();
        c.model = "Fortuner";
        c.displayModel();

        System.out.println(Car.manufacturer);
    }
}
```

## 11. Common Mistakes

* Not initializing local variables
* Using unclear names like `x`, `y`, `data`
* Mixing camelCase and PascalCase incorrectly
* Declaring too many global variables instead of local ones
* Using `static` unnecessarily

## 12. Summary

* Variables store data and have a type, name, and value.
* Three types of variables: **local**, **instance**, **static**.
* Variables differ by **scope**, **memory location**, and **lifetime**.
* Naming conventions improve readability.
* Proper initialization and scope management lead to clean code.

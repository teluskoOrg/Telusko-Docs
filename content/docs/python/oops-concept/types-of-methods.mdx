# Types of Methods in Python


In Python, methods define the **behavior of a class** and determine how data is accessed and modified.
Based on **what they operate on**—object data, class-level data, or no data at all—Python provides **three types of methods**:

1. Instance Methods
2. Class Methods
3. Static Methods

## Variables and Their Scope

Before exploring method types, it is important to understand **variable scope**:

<Step>
## Instance Methods

### What Are Instance Methods?

* Instance methods are the **most common type of methods**
* They use `self` as the first parameter
* They operate on **instance variables**
* Each object maintains its own independent state

### Example

```python
class Computer:
    brand = "Telusko AI"

    def __init__(self, cpu, ram, ssd):
        print("init called")
        self.cpu = cpu
        self.ram = ram
        self.ssd = ssd

    def config(self):
        print("config :", self.cpu, self.ram, self.ssd)

com1 = Computer("i5", "16GB", "512GB")
com2 = Computer("i9", "96GB", "2TB")

com1.config()
com2.config()
print(Computer.brand)
```

### Output

```
init called
init called
config : i5 16GB 512GB
config : i9 96GB 2TB
Telusko AI
```

### Key Points

* `self` refers to the current object
* Instance methods work with **object-specific data**
* Changes affect **only that object**

</Step>

<Step>
## Class Methods

### What Are Class Methods?

* Defined using the `@classmethod` decorator
* Use `cls` as the first parameter (by convention)
* Work with **class variables**
* The class itself is passed automatically, not an object

### Example

```python
class Computer:
    brand = "Telusko AI"

    def __init__(self, cpu, ram, ssd):
        self.cpu = cpu
        self.ram = ram
        self.ssd = ssd

    def config(self):
        print("config :", self.cpu, self.ram, self.ssd)

    @classmethod
    def info(cls):
        return cls.brand

print(Computer.info())
```

### Output

```
Telusko AI
```

### Key Points

* Class methods operate on **shared data**
* Modifying class variables affects **all objects**
* Often used for **factory methods** or class-level information

</Step>

<Step>
## Static Methods

### What Are Static Methods?

* Defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator
* Do **not** receive `self` or `cls`
* Independent of both object and class state
* Used as **utility or helper functions**

### Example

```python
class Computer:
    @staticmethod
    def gb_to_bytes(gb):
        return gb * (1024 ** 3)

print(Computer.gb_to_bytes(16))
```

### Output

```
17179869184
```

### Key Points

* No access to instance or class variables
* Logically related to the class
* Improves code organization and readability

</Step>

## Impact of Variable Scope

* Modifying a **class variable** using the class name affects all objects
* Modifying an **instance variable** using `self` affects only that object
* Instance and class variables exist in **separate namespaces**

## Summary

* Python provides **three types of methods**: instance, class, and static.
* Instance methods operate on **object-specific (instance) data** using `self`.
* Class methods operate on **shared class-level data** using `cls`.
* Static methods act as **utility functions**, independent of class and object state.
* Using the appropriate method type results in **cleaner, more maintainable, and well-structured object-oriented code**.

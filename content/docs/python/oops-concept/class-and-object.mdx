## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that models real-world problems using **objects**. Python supports both functional and object-oriented programming, but OOP is especially effective for building **large, real-life, and scalable applications**.

In OOP:

* Real-world entities are represented as objects
* Objects contain both **data** and **behavior**
* Programs become more structured, reusable, and easier to maintain


---


## What Is a Class?

A **class** is a **blueprint** or template used to create objects.

It defines:

* **Properties (attributes):** Data or characteristics
* **Behaviors (methods):** Actions the object can perform

> Example:
> A `Computer` class defines what a computer *has* (RAM, processor) and what it *does* (display configuration).

A single class can be used to create **multiple objects**, all sharing the same structure.


---


## What Is an Object?

An **object** is a **runtime instance of a class**.

* Objects are created using the class name followed by parentheses
* Each object has its own identity and memory
* Objects can access class-defined methods and data

```python
comp1 = Computer()
comp2 = Computer()
```

Here, `comp1` and `comp2` are **two different objects** created from the same class.

## Creating a Class in Python

In Python, classes are defined using the `class` keyword.

```python
class Computer:
    pass
```

* `pass` indicates an empty class
* Defining a class does **not** create an object


### Instantiating an Object

To create an object:

* Use **round brackets** after the class name
* This process is called **instantiation**

```python
comp1 = Computer()
```

❌ This does NOT create an object:

```python
comp1 = Computer
```

It only assigns the class reference.


### Objects and Types in Python

Python is fundamentally object-oriented.

Examples:

```python
a = 10
print(type(a))        # <class 'int'>
print(type(comp1))    # <class '__main__.Computer'>
```

* Integers belong to the `int` class
* Custom objects belong to their defined class


---


## Defining Methods in a Class

Methods are defined using `def` inside a class.

```python
class Computer:
    def config(self):
        print("i7, 16GB, 1TB")
```

### Calling Methods

Methods can be called in two ways:

**Using the object (recommended):**

```python
com1 = Computer()
com1.config()
```

**Using the class (explicitly passing the object):**

```python
Computer.config(com1)
```

In both cases:

The object is passed as `self` automatically when using `object.method().`

### The Role of `self`

* `self` refers to the current object instance
* It allows methods to:
    * Access object data
    * Modify object attributes
* Enables multiple objects to share the same method logic while operating on different data

```python
class Computer:
    def config(self):
        print("i7, 16GB, 1TB")

com1 = Computer()
com2 = Computer()

com1.config()
com2.config()

```
Both objects use the same method but remain independent.

## Multiple Objects from One Class

* A single class can create multiple objects
* Each object:
    * Has its own memory location
    * Maintains independent state
* Methods are shared, data is separate

This is similar to:
* Multiple remotes controlling different devices
* Multiple humans sharing behaviors but having different identities

## Summary

* A class is a blueprint while an object is its instance.
* Objects are created using constructor syntax `ClassName()`.
* `self` represents the current object.
* Methods operate on object-specific data.
* Multiple objects share the same class but hold independent state.
* Python treats everything as an object at its core.

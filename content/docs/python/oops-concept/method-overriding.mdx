## What is Method Overriding?

Method overriding in Python allows a **subclass (child class)** to provide its **own implementation** of a method that is already defined in its **superclass (parent class)**.

When a method is overridden:

* The **child class version** of the method is executed
* The **parent class version** is ignored for that object


> Method overriding occurs when a child class defines a method with the **same name and same parameters** as a method in the parent class, and the child’s method replaces the parent’s behavior.


---


## Why Method Overriding is Needed

Method overriding enables:

* **Customization of inherited behavior**
* **Polymorphism** in object-oriented programming
* **Real-world modeling**, where subclasses behave differently

Example:

* A generic phone may have a `show()` method
* Different brands may implement it differently


---


## Basic Example Without Inheritance

```python
class A:
    def show(self):
        print("in A show")

class B:
    def show(self):
        print("in B show")

obj1 = B()
obj1.show()
```

**Output**

```
in B show
```

Here, class `B` has its own `show()` method, so it is executed.
However, this is **method redefinition**, not true overriding, because there is **no inheritance**.


---


## Method Overriding Using Inheritance

### Parent Class

```python
class A:
    def show(self):
        print("in A show")
```

### Child Class (Without Override)

```python
class B(A):
    pass
```

```python
obj = B()
obj.show()
```

**Output**

```
in A show
```

* Since `B` does not define `show()`, it inherits the method from class `A`.


### Child Class (With Override)

```python
class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print("in B show")
```

```python
obj = B()
obj.show()
```

**Output**

```
in B show
```

* The child class method **overrides** the parent class method.

## How Python Decides Which Method to Call?

Python determines method execution based on the **actual object type**, not the reference or parent class.

> “The method called depends on the object created, not the class it inherits from.”

This behavior is known as **runtime polymorphism**.


### Rules for Method Overriding

For method overriding to occur:

* Method name must be **same**
* Parameters must be **same**
* Inheritance must exist
* Method resolution happens at **runtime**
* The child class method takes **priority**


### Real-World Analogy

* A student tells friends he has a **Nokia phone**
* Later, he gets a **Motorola**
* When asked again, he no longer says Nokia — he now says Motorola

The **new behavior replaces the old one**

Similarly:

* Parent class method → Nokia
* Child class method → Motorola
* Child method **overrides** parent behavior


---


## Overriding Built-in Methods (`__str__` Example)

Method overriding is also used to customize **built-in methods**.

### Default Behavior

```python
obj = object()
print(obj)
```

Shows memory address.


### Overriding `__str__()`

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Student name: {self.name}"
```

```python
s = Student("Navin")
print(s)
```

**Output**

```
Student name: Navin
```

* The child class overrides `object.__str__()` to provide meaningful output.

## Method Overriding vs Method Overloading 

| Feature          | Overriding     | Overloading                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Classes involved | Parent & Child | Same class                                    |
| Method name      | Same           | Same                                          |
| Parameters       | Same           | Different                                     |
| Runtime decision | Yes            | No (Python does not support true overloading) |


---


## Summary

* Method overriding allows a **subclass to modify or enhance the behavior** of a method inherited from its parent class.
* When a method is overridden, the **child class implementation is executed**, replacing the parent class version for that object.
* Python determines which method to invoke based on the **actual class of the object at runtime**, not the reference type.
* Method overriding is a key mechanism for achieving **runtime polymorphism** in Python.
* Built-in methods such as `__str__()`, `__init__()`, and others are **frequently overridden** to provide meaningful and customized behavior for objects.

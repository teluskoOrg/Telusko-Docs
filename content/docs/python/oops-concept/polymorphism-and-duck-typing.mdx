## What is Polymorphism?

**Polymorphism** means *“many forms”*.

In Python, polymorphism allows **the same method or function name to behave differently depending on the object that is passed to it**.

Instead of checking an object’s type, Python focuses on **what the object can do**.

In simple terms:

> *Different objects can respond to the same method call in different ways.*


### Polymorphism in Python is Behavior-Based

Unlike some statically typed languages, Python does **not require inheritance** or strict type matching to achieve polymorphism.

Python supports polymorphism through:

* **Dynamic typing**
* **Duck typing**

As long as an object has the **required methods or attributes**, it can be used.

## 3. Duck Typing – The Core Idea

Duck typing follows this famous principle:

> **“If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.”**

In Python:

* The **actual class or type of an object does not matter**
* What matters is **whether the object implements the required behavior (methods)**

### Key Rule:

✔️ If an object has the required method → it works

❌ If it does not → Python raises an error

## 4. Understanding with an Example

### Classes with Similar Behavior

```python
class Laptop:        # duck
    def build(self):
        print("Laptop builds")

class Desktop:       # crow
    def build(self):
        print("Desktop builds")

class Tablet:
    def open_pdf(self):
        print("Opening PDF")
```

Here:

* `Laptop` and `Desktop` both have a **build()** method
* `Tablet` does **not** have a `build()` method



### A Class That Uses Any “Machine”

```python
class Alien:
    def code(self, machine: Laptop):
        print("Alien building...")
        machine.build()
```

**Note:**

* The type hint `machine: Laptop` is **not enforced at runtime**
* Python will only check **whether `machine.build()` exists**


---


## Object Usage and Output

```python
asus_rog = Laptop()
beast = Desktop()
lenevo_tab = Tablet()

muskan = Alien()
```

### Case 1: Laptop object

```python
muskan.code(asus_rog)
```

**Output:**

```
Alien building...
Laptop builds
```

✔️ Works because `Laptop` has `build()`


### Case 2: Desktop object

```python
muskan.code(beast)
```

**Output:**

```
Alien building...
Desktop builds
```

✔️ Works even though `Desktop` is a different class
✔️ Because it also has `build()`

> **This is duck typing in action**


### Case 3: Tablet object

```python
muskan.code(lenevo_tab)
```

**Output:**

```
AttributeError: 'Tablet' object has no attribute 'build'
```

❌ Fails because `Tablet` does **not** implement `build()`


### Why This Is Polymorphism?

* The same method call:

```python
machine.build()
```

* Different implementations:

  - Laptop → Laptop builds

  - Desktop → Desktop builds

* Same interface, different behavior.
* This is runtime polymorphism driven by duck typing.

> Python prioritizes **behavior over type**.
> Objects are compatible **only if they implement the required method**, regardless of their class.


* This makes code:

  * Flexible
  * Reusable
  * Extensible


### Real-World Analogy 

You expect a duck that can quack.
Someone gives you a crow that quacks.

Python says:

> “I don’t care what it is.
> If it quacks, it’s acceptable.”

## Summary

* Polymorphism in Python allows the same method call to produce different behaviors across objects.
* Duck typing enables polymorphism by focusing on behavior rather than inheritance or type.
* Python determines compatibility by checking for required methods, not class hierarchy.
* Runtime errors occur only when an object lacks the expected behavior.
* Dynamic typing makes Python flexible, expressive, and easy to extend.

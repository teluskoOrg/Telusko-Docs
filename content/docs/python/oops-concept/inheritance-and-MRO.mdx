Inheritance is one of the core pillars of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python.
It allows a new class (child) to **reuse, extend, and customize** the behavior of an existing class (parent), promoting code reusability and logical organization.

Python supports multiple forms of inheritance and uses a well-defined mechanism called **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** to decide which method is executed when multiple classes define methods with the same name.


---


## What is Inheritance?

* Inheritance allows a class to **acquire methods and properties** of another class
* The existing class is called the **parent (base) class**
* The new class is called the **child (derived) class**
* Child classes can access parent methods, but parents cannot access child methods

## Types of Inheritance in Python

| Type         | Description                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Single-Level | One child inherits from one parent       |
| Multi-Level  | Parent → Child → Grandchild              |
| Multiple     | One child inherits from multiple parents |


---

<Step>
## Single-Level Inheritance

A child class inherits from a single parent class.

![Single_Inheritance](https://dyz1pdcuffwr5.cloudfront.net/Python/single_inheritance.png)

### Example

```python
class A:
    def f1(self):
        print("f1 works")

    def f2(self):
        print("f2 works")

class B(A):
    def f3(self):
        print("f3 works")

    def f4(self):
        print("f4 works")

obj = B()
obj.f1()
```

### Output

```
f1 works
```

### Explanation

* `A` is the parent class
* `B` is the child class
* `B` inherits methods `f1()` and `f2()` from `A`

</Step>

---


## Access Rules in Inheritance

* A **child class can access all parent methods**
* A **parent class cannot access child methods**
* Sibling classes **cannot access each other’s methods**

### Example

```python
class C(A):
    def f5(self):
        print("f5 works")

obj = B()
obj.f5()
```

### Output

```
AttributeError: 'B' object has no attribute 'f5'
```


---

<Step>
## Multi-Level Inheritance

A class inherits from another child class, forming a hierarchy.

![Multi_Level_Inheritance](https://dyz1pdcuffwr5.cloudfront.net/Python/multilevel_inheritance.png)

### Example

```python
class A:
    def f1(self):
        print("f1 works")

    def f2(self):
        print("f2 works")

class B(A):
    def f3(self):
        print("f3 works")

    def f4(self):
        print("f4 works")

class C(A):
    def f5(self):
        print("f5 works")

obj = B()
obj.f4()
```

### Output

```
f4 works
```

* Properties flow from **grandparent to parent to child**
* Commonly used for hierarchical relationships

</Step>

---

<Step>
## Multiple Inheritance

A child class inherits from **multiple parent classes**.

![Multiple_Inheritance](https://dyz1pdcuffwr5.cloudfront.net/Python/multiple_inheritance.png)

### Example

```python
class A:
    def show(self):
        print("in A show")

class B:
    def show(self):
        print("in B show")

class C(A, B):
    pass

obj = C()
obj.show()
```

### Output

```
in A show
```

### Explanation

* Both `A` and `B` define `show()`
* Python selects the method based on **MRO**

</Step>

---


## Method Resolution Order (MRO)

### What is MRO?

* MRO defines the **order in which Python searches classes** for a method
* Python searches:

  1. The child class
  2. Parent classes from **left to right**
  3. Grandparents (if any)
   

### MRO Depends on Inheritance Order

**Example**

```python
class C(B, A):
    pass

obj = C()
obj.show()
```

**Output**

```
in B show
```

➡ Changing the order of parent classes changes the method selected.


### Explicit Parent Method Call

If needed, you can directly call a specific parent’s method.

```python
B.show(obj)
```

**Output**

```
in B show
```

This bypasses MRO and calls the method explicitly.

## How Python Resolves Method Conflicts?

> Child class methods take **highest priority**, if not found, Python checks parent classes **in MRO order**

## Summary

* Inheritance is a powerful feature in Python that enables structured code reuse and extensibility.
* Child classes can access parent methods, not vice versa.
* Python supports single-level, multi-level, and multiple inheritance.
* When multiple inheritance is used, Python relies on Method Resolution Order (MRO) to determine which method to execute, ensuring predictable and consistent behavior in complex class hierarchies.

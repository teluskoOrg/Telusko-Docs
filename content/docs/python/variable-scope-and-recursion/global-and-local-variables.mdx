In Python, the **scope** of a variable determines **where it can be accessed and modified**. Based on scope, variables are mainly classified into **global variables** and **local variables**.

<Step>
## Global Variables

* **Global variables** are defined **outside any function**.
* They are accessible **throughout the program**, including inside functions (for reading).
* By default, a function can **read** a global variable but **cannot modify it** directly.

### Example: Accessing a Global Variable

```python
a = 10   # global variable

def something():
    print("inside :", a)

something()
print("outside :", a)
```

**Output:**

```
inside : 10
outside : 10
```

Here, the function can **read** the global variable `a` without any issue.

</Step>

<Step>
## Local Variables

* **Local variables** are defined **inside a function**.
* They are accessible **only within that function**.
* Attempting to access a local variable outside its function results in a **NameError**.

### Example: Local Variable Scope

```python
def something():
    a = 15   # local variable
    print("inside :", a)

something()
print("outside :", a)
```

**Output:**

```
inside : 15
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
```

The variable `a` exists **only inside the function**, so it cannot be accessed outside.

</Step>

<Step>
## Same Variable Name in Global and Local Scope

* Python allows **global and local variables to have the same name**.
* They are treated as **separate and independent variables**.
* Modifying the local variable does **not affect** the global variable.

### Example: Separate Global and Local Variables

```python
a = 10   # global variable

def something():
    a = 15   # local variable
    print("inside :", a)

something()
print("outside :", a)
```

**Output:**

```
inside : 15
outside : 10
```

This demonstrates that the local `a` **shadows** the global `a` inside the function.

</Step>

## Modifying Global Variables Inside a Function

By default, Python treats variables assigned inside a function as **local**. To modify a global variable from within a function, Python provides **two approaches**.


### 1. Using the `global` Keyword

* The `global` keyword tells Python that the variable refers to the **global scope**.
* This allows direct modification of the global variable.

```python
a = 10

def something():
    global a
    a = 20
    print("inside :", a)

something()
print("outside :", a)
```

**Output:**

```
inside : 20
outside : 20
```


### 2. Using the `globals()` Function

* `globals()` returns a **dictionary of all global variables**.
* You can modify a global variable by accessing it using its **string name** as a key.
* This method modifies the **global variable**, not the local one.

```python
a = 10

def something():
    a = 15      # local variable
    globals()['a'] = 20
    print("inside :", a)

something()
print("outside :", a)
```

**Output:**

```
inside : 15
outside : 20
```

Here:

* Local `a` remains `15`
* Global `a` is updated to `20`

</Step>

##  Summary

* Local variables exist only within their function scope, any variable **defined inside a function is local by default**.
* Global variables are **defined outside** functions and can be accessed (read) anywhere in the program, including inside functions.
* To **modify a global variable** from within a function, you must explicitly:
    * declare it using the global keyword, or
    * update it through the globals() dictionary.
* Local and global variables with the same name are treated as **separate variables** and do not affect each other unless explicitly connected.

This clear separation of scopes enhances **code safety, readability, and long-term maintainability**.

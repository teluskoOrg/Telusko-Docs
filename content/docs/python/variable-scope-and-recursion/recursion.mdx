## Introduction to Recursion

**Recursion** is a programming technique where a **function calls itself** to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.

It is commonly used for problems that have a **repetitive or self-similar structure**, such as factorials, tree traversal, and mathematical sequences.

In Python, recursion must be handled carefully to avoid infinite calls and runtime errors.

### Basic Concept of Recursion

A recursive function typically consists of two essential parts:

1. **Base Case**
   A condition that stops the recursion. Without this, the function will call itself indefinitely.

2. **Recursive Case**
   The part where the function calls itself with modified arguments.

Without a base case, recursion leads to a runtime error.

## Example: Infinite Recursion (Without Base Case)

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello")
    greet()

greet()
```

### Output

```
Hello
Hello
Hello
...
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```

### Explanation

* The function `greet()` calls itself continuously.
* There is **no base condition** to stop execution.
* Python eventually raises a `RecursionError` to prevent system crash.

## Recursion Depth Limit in Python

Python restricts the maximum number of recursive calls to **prevent excessive memory usage and stack overflow**.

### Checking the Recursion Limit

```python
import sys
print(sys.getrecursionlimit())
```

**Output:**

```
1000
```

This means Python allows **up to 1000 nested function calls** by default.


### Modifying the Recursion Limit

You can increase the recursion limit if required (with caution):

```python
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)
print(sys.getrecursionlimit())
```

**Output:**

```
10000
```

**Warning:**
Increasing the recursion limit too much may cause:

* Stack overflow
* High memory consumption
* Program or system crash

## Recursion Using `sleep()`

You can slow down recursive execution to better understand how recursion works.

### Example with Delay

```python
from time import sleep

count = 1

def greet():
    global count
    print("Hello", count)
    count += 1
    sleep(0.02)
    greet()

greet()
```

### Explanation

* `sleep(0.02)` pauses execution for **20 milliseconds**.
* This helps visualize recursive calls step by step.
* The `global` keyword allows modification of the global variable `count`.


---


## Use of `global` in Recursion

* Variables inside functions are **local by default**.
* To modify a global variable inside a recursive function, you must declare it using `global`.

```python
global count
```

Without this declaration, Python treats `count` as a local variable and raises an error.


---


## Summary

* Recursion involves a function calling itself and must always include a base case to stop execution.
* Python enforces a recursion depth limit (default 1000) to prevent stack overflow and runtime errors.
* Recursive solutions are often clear and elegant, but usually less efficient than iterative approaches.
* Recursion should be used only when it naturally models the problem, such as in tree structures or divide-and-conquer logic.

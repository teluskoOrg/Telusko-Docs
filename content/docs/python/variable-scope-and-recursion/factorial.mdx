## What is a Factorial?

The **factorial** of a non-negative integer `n`, written as `n!`, is the product of all positive integers from `1` to `n`.

**Example:**

```
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
```

### Mathematical Definition

For any integer `n ≥ 1`:

```
n! = 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × n
```

Special case:

```
0! = 1
```

Factorial is a fundamental mathematical concept that helps build logical thinking and is widely used in programming to understand **loops, functions, and recursion**.

## Why Factorial is Important in Programming?

* Strengthens understanding of **loops and iteration**
* Acts as a stepping stone to **recursion**
* Commonly used in **combinatorics**, **probability**, and **algorithm design**
* Demonstrates how programs handle **large numbers**

## Implementing Factorial Using a Loop (Iterative Approach)

### Step-by-Step Logic

1. Accept a number `num` as input.
2. Initialize a result variable (`res`) to `1`.
3. Loop from `1` to `num` (inclusive).
4. Multiply `res` by each number in the loop.
5. Return the final result.

### Example

```python
def fact(num):
    res = 1
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        res = res * i
    return res

result = fact(5)
print(result)
```

**Output:**

```
120
```

Here,
* `res = 1`
  Initializes the accumulator for multiplication.

* `range(1, num + 1)`
  Ensures all numbers from `1` to `num` are included.

* `res = res * i`
  Continuously multiplies values to build the factorial.

### More Examples

```python
print(fact(12))
```

**Output:**

```
479001600
```

## Handling Large Factorials in Python

* Factorials grow **very rapidly** (non-linear growth).
* Example:

  ```
  20! = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000
  ```
* Python supports **arbitrary-precision integers**, so it can handle very large factorials such as `100!` or even `1000!`.
* However, extremely large factorials may consume significant **memory and time**, depending on system limits.

## Summary

* Factorial multiplies all positive integers up to a given number.
* It can be implemented easily using a **for loop**.
* Python handles large factorials efficiently due to dynamic integer sizing.
* Factorial is foundational for understanding **loops, functions, and recursion**.
* Widely used in mathematics and real-world programming problems.

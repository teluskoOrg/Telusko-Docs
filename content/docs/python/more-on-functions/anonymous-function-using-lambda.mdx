## Introduction to Anonymous Functions

An **anonymous function** is a function that is defined **without a name**.
In Python, such functions are created using the **`lambda` keyword**.

Unlike regular functions defined using `def`, anonymous functions:

* Are usually **short-lived**
* Are written in **a single line**
* Focus on **one specific operation**

They are mainly used when a function is required **temporarily** and defining a full function would be unnecessary.

## What Is a Lambda Function?

A **lambda function** is Python’s way of creating an anonymous function.
It allows you to define a function using a **single expression** instead of a full function block.

Lambda functions:

* Do not have a name by default
* Return a value automatically
* Contain only one expression
* Improve code brevity and clarity when used correctly

### Lambda Functions and First-Class Functions

In Python, **functions are first-class citizens**, meaning:

* Functions can be assigned to variables
* Functions can be passed as arguments
* Functions can be returned from other functions

## Lambda Function Syntax

```python
lambda parameters: expression
```

**Explanation:**

* `lambda` → keyword used to define the function
* `parameters` → input values (one or more)
* `expression` → a single expression whose result is returned

- No `return` keyword

- No function body or indentation

## Regular Function vs Lambda Function

#### Regular Function Example

```python
def square(num):
    return num * num

print(square(5))
```

#### Lambda Function Equivalent

```python
square = lambda num: num * num
print(square(5))
```

**Output:**

```
25
```


---


## Assigning Lambda Functions to Variables

Although lambda functions are anonymous, they can be assigned to variables and used like named functions.

```python
fun = lambda num: num * num
print(fun(5))
```

**Output:**

```
25
```

Here:

* `fun` references the lambda function
* The function remains anonymous but is callable through the variable


---


## Lambda Functions with Multiple Parameters

Lambda functions can accept **multiple parameters**, just like regular functions.

```python
add = lambda a, b: a + b
print(add(4, 5))
```

**Output:**

```
9
```

This is useful for quick arithmetic or comparison operations.


---


## Lambda Functions with Higher-Order Functions

Lambda functions are commonly used with **higher-order functions**, which accept other functions as arguments.

```python
def operate(num, operation):
    return operation(num)

result = operate(5, lambda x: x * x)
print(result)
```

**Output:**

```
25
```

Here:

* The lambda function is passed directly
* No separate function definition is required
* Code becomes more compact and expressive


---


## Advantages vs Limitations of Lambda Functions

### Advantages:
* Reduce code length
* Improve readability for simple logic
* Eliminate unnecessary function definitions
* Ideal for temporary and one-time use functions
* Frequently used with `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`
  

### Limitations:
* Only **one expression** allowed
* Cannot contain multiple statements
* Not suitable for complex logic
* Overuse can reduce readability

## Summary

* Lambda functions are **anonymous, single-expression functions**
* Anonymous functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword
* They can automatically return the result of an expression
* They can take one or multiple parameters
* Lambda functions are often used with higher-order functions
* Lambda functions are best suited for **short, simple, and temporary operations**

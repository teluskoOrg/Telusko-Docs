# Inner Functions in Python

## What is an Inner Function?

An **inner function** is a function defined **inside another function**.
It is **local to the outer function** and cannot be accessed directly from outside its scope.

* Inner functions help organize code logically.
* They are commonly used for **helper logic**, **encapsulation**, and **decorators**.


### Scope and Accessibility

* An inner function is **only accessible within its outer function**.
* Trying to call it directly from outside results in a `NameError`.

### Example

```python
def outer():
    print("In outer function")
    def inner():
        print("In inner function")

outer()
inner()
```

**Output**

```
In outer function
NameError: name 'inner' is not defined
```

This happens because `inner()` exists only inside `outer()`.

<Step>
## Calling an Inner Function from the Outer Function

An inner function can be called **within the outer function itself**.

```python
def outer():
    print("In Outer function")
    def inner():
        print("In Inner function")
    inner()

outer()
```

**Output**

```
In Outer function
In Inner function
```


</Step>

<Step>
## Returning the Result of an Inner Function

When the **outer function calls the inner function and returns its result**, the inner function is executed immediately, and its return value is passed back to the caller.

* The inner function runs during the execution of the outer function.
* The outer function does not return the function, only the final value produced by the inner function.

```python
def outer():
    print("In Outer function")
    def inner():
        print("In Inner function")
        return 5
    return inner()

result = outer()
print(result)
```

**Output**

```
In Outer function
In Inner function
5
```

**If no value is returned, Python returns `None` by default.**
```python
def outer():
    print("In Outer function")
    def inner():
        print("In Inner function")

    return inner()

result = outer()
print(result)
```

**Output**

```
In Outer function
In Inner function
None
```

> Use this approach when the inner function is only needed to compute a value and does not need to be reused later.

</Step>

<Step>
## Returning the Inner Function Itself (Closures)

When the outer function **returns the inner function without parentheses**, it returns a **function reference**, not its execution result.
* The inner function is **not executed immediately.**
* The returned function can be stored in a variable and called later.
* This creates a **closure**, where the inner function retains access to the outer function’s variables even after the outer function has finished executing.

```python
def outer():
    print("In Outer function")
    def inner():
        print("In Inner function")
    return inner

func = outer()
print(func)
```

**Output**

```
In Outer function
<function outer.<locals>.inner at 0x...>
```

Here, `func` now holds a reference to the inner function.

> Returning a function enables **delayed execution** and preserves the outer function’s context.

</Step>

<Step>
## Calling the Returned Inner Function

Once an inner function is returned and assigned to a variable, it behaves like a normal function.
* The function can be invoked multiple times.
* It retains access to variables from the outer function (closure behavior).
* This enables flexible and reusable logic.

```python
def outer():
    print("In Outer function")
    def inner():
        print("In Inner function")
    return inner

func = outer()
func()
```

**Output**

```
In Outer function
In Inner function
```

> Calling a returned inner function allows execution **outside the original scope**, while still maintaining access to the outer function’s data.

</Step>


---

<Step>
## Inner Functions with Parameters

Inner functions can accept **parameters**, just like regular functions.
* Parameters allow dynamic input during execution.
* Combined with closures, this allows functions to operate on both:
    - Values passed during the outer function call
    - Values passed during the inner function call

This design supports customizable behavior and is widely used in decorators and functional programming patterns.

```python
def outer():
    print("In Outer function")
    def inner(num):
        print("In Inner function", num)
    return inner

func = outer()
func(5)
```

**Output**

```
In Outer function
In Inner function 5
```

> Parameters make inner functions adaptable and reusable while preserving outer scope data.


### Closures and Variable Access

When an inner function is returned, it forms a **closure**, meaning:

* It **remembers and can access variables** from the outer function even after the outer function has finished execution.

To **modify** outer variables, use the `nonlocal` keyword.

</Step>

## Summary

* Inner functions are defined inside outer functions to **encapsulate logic** and avoid polluting the global namespace.
* They are **accessible only within the outer function**, improving code safety and control.
* Inner functions can be **called immediately or returned and stored** for later execution.
* Returning an inner function creates a **closure**, preserving access to outer variables.
* They are commonly used in **decorators, callbacks, and functional programming** for reusable and flexible designs.

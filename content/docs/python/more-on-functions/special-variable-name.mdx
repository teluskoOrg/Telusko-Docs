## What Is `__name__`?

`__name__` is a **special built-in variable** in Python that stores the **name of the current module**.
Its value changes depending on **how the Python file is executed**.

* If a file is **run directly**, `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`
* If a file is **imported as a module**, `__name__` is set to the **module’s filename** (without `.py`)

This behavior allows Python programs to **distinguish between direct execution and import usage**.


---


## Why Is `__name__` Important?

When a Python file is imported:

* All top-level statements execute immediately.
* This can cause unexpected output or side effects.

To avoid this, Python provides the `__name__` check to control what code runs in different contexts.


**`__name__` and `globals()`**

```python
print(globals())
print(__name__)
```

* `globals()` displays all global variables in the current module
* `__name__` appears as part of the global namespace
* Helps in debugging and understanding runtime context


---


## The `if __name__ == "__main__":` Guard

This construct ensures that certain code runs **only when the file is executed directly**, not when imported.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # code runs only when file is executed directly
```

### Key Benefits:

* Prevents unwanted execution during imports
* Keeps modules clean and reusable
* Separates **test/debug code** from reusable logic

### Example

**`calc.py`**

```python
print("In calc", __name__)
```

**`demo.py`**

```python
import calc
print("In demo", __name__)
```

**Output:**

```text
$ python calc.py
In calc __main__

$ python demo.py
In calc calc
In demo __main__
```

**Explanation:**

* `calc.py` run directly → `__name__ == "__main__"`
* `calc.py` imported → `__name__ == "calc"`
* `demo.py` is the entry point → `__name__ == "__main__"`

## Practical Use Case: Protecting Test Code

### `calc.py`

```python
def add():
    return "addition"

def sub():
    return "subtraction"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(add())
    print(sub())
```

### `demo.py`

```python
from calc import *

result = add()
print("In demo", result)
```

### Output:

```text
$ python calc.py
addition
subtraction

$ python demo.py
In demo addition
```

### Explanation:

* Test code runs **only** when `calc.py` is executed directly
* Importing `calc` does not trigger test output

## Summary

* `__name__` identifies the **execution context** of a Python module at runtime.
* A value of `"__main__"` indicates that the script is being **executed directly** as the program’s entry point.
* Helps **prevent unintended code execution** when modules are imported into other programs.
* Promotes **clean separation** between reusable logic and test or execution-specific code.
* Enables writing **modular, reusable, and maintainable** Python applications following best practices.

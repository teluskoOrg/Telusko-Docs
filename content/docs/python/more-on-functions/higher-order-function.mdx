## Introduction to Higher-Order Functions

In Python, a higher-order function is a function that can **accept another function as an argument** or **return a function as its result**.
This is possible because Python treats functions as **first-class citizens**, meaning functions behave like regular objects.

As a result, functions can be:
* Assigned to variables
* Passed as parameters
* Returned from other functions
* Stored in data structures

This capability makes Python well-suited for functional programming concepts.

## Why Higher-Order Functions Matter

Higher-order functions allow you to:

* Write **generic and reusable code**
* Separate **what to do** from **how to do it**
* Avoid writing multiple similar functions
* Dynamically change behavior by passing different functions

Instead of writing separate logic for squaring, cubing, or other operations, a single higher-order function can handle all cases.

## Basic Example: Passing a Function as an Argument

A function can receive another function as a parameter and execute it dynamically.

```python
def square(num):
    return num * num

def cube(num):
    return num * num * num

def operate(num, operation):
    return operation(num)

value = 5
result = operate(value, square)
print(result)
```

**Output:**

```
25
```

Here:

* `operate` is a **higher-order function**
* `square` is passed as an argument
* `operation(num)` dynamically executes the passed function

Changing the behavior requires **no change** to the higher-order function:

```python
result = operate(value, cube)
print(result)
```

**Output:**

```
125
```

## Higher-Order Function with Multiple Values

Higher-order functions can also process **collections of data**.

```python
def square(num):
    return num * num

def cube(num):
    return num * num * num

def operate(nums, operation):
    for i in nums:
        print(operation(i))

nums = [5, 6, 7]
operate(nums, cube)
```

**Output:**

```
125
216
343
```

Here:

* A list of values is passed
* The same function works for **any operation**
* Only the behavior changes, not the structure of the code


---


## Key Characteristics

* The higher-order function does **not care about the logic** of the operation
* It only knows **when and how to call** the passed function
* This enables **abstraction and flexibility**

### Real-World Use Cases

Higher-order functions are widely used in:

* Data transformation pipelines
* Callback functions
* Event handling
* Functional utilities
* Clean and scalable code design

## Summary

* Higher-order functions accept other functions as arguments.
* They rely on Python’s first-class function support.
* They enable abstraction, flexibility, and code reuse.
* The behavior can be changed dynamically without modifying core logic.
* Commonly used in functional programming and real-world applications.
